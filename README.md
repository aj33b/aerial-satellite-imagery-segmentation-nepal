This project is part of my Master of Technology in Artificial Intelligence thesis at Kathmandu University. It involves the implementation of several models to train on a custom drone image dataset of Nepal, with a focus on landcover segmentation. The classes include buildings and woodlands.

## Installation and Environment Setup

To set up the development environment, you need to install the required packages and create an environment using conda. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```

Now you can activate the environment using the following command:

```bash
conda activate <env>
```

You can check the ipynb files in the notebooks folder to see the implementation of the models and further instructions.
